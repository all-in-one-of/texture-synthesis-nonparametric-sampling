# Texture Synthesis 

Based on "Texture Synthesis with Non-Parametric Sampling" paper by Alexei A. Efros and Thomas K. Leung

There are 2 versions: Python and Houdini

### Python

For Python version you would need:
* Python 3.7
* Jupyter Notebook (my version is 5.6.0)
* Numpy (my version is 1.15.1)
* Matplotlib (2.2.3)
* Scipy (1.1.0)
* Skimage (0.14.0)
* imageio (2.4.1) (if you want to make a GIF :))
* PIL (5.2.0)

To start, open the Jupyter Notebook file "Texture Synthesis", and follow the instructions :) 

### Houdini

For Houdini:
* Houdini 17 (might work with earlier versions, haven't tried)

To start, open TextureSynthesis<...>.hipnc file and follow the instructions inside (they are scarce, but present)
Use this file at your own risk :D  WARNING: it's very very slow! (you might wanna use it on smaller images...) and the results are less nice that the Python version
